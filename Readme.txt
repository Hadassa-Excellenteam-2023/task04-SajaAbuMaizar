The chosen data structure for this exercise is a struct called City, which represents a city with its name and coordinates. The struct has three members: name, x, and y, which respectively store the name of the city and its x and y coordinates on a map.

The vector cities is used to store multiple instances of the City struct. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of city data, as well as dynamic resizing if needed. By using a vector, we can easily add new cities or remove existing ones during the program's execution, as mentioned in the exercise requirements.

Overall, this data structure provides a convenient way to store and manipulate city information, making it suitable for performing searches based on city proximity and radius.
